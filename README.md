# Image-Captioning-using-Deep-Learning
The aim of this project is to detect abstract objects in an image and then give description about those object as seen
in the image.
Using the Flickr 8k dataset where each image consists of 5 captions.
Used Inceptionv3 model for getting the feature vector by removing its softmax layer.
Used LSTM for generating captions.
Achieved BLEU score of 0.61.
